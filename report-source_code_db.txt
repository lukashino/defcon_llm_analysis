1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---------------------
Critical Vulnerability Assessment:
- High-Risk Vulnerabilities Detected: 5
- Potential Attack Surface: Significant
- Immediate Remediation Recommended

2. METHODOLOGY AND GOALS
-------------------------
Threat Modeling Approach:

- Severity: CRITICAL (9.8/10)

B. INJECTION VULNERABILITIES
- Potential SQL/ORM injection points
- Unvalidated user input processing
- Severity: HIGH (8.5/10)

C. AUTHENTICATION BYPASS
- Weak session management
- Potential authentication logic flaws
- Severity: HIGH (8.2/10)

D. SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE
- Potential hardcoded credentials
- Weak encryption mechanisms
- Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH (7.5/10)

E. CSRF PROTECTION WEAKNESS
- Incomplete cross-site request forgery defenses
- Potential for state-changing requests
- Severity: MEDIUM (6.5/10)
