1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-------------------
A comprehensive security assessment of the Task Manager application revealed multiple high-risk vulnerabilities across authentication, cryptographic, and configuration domains. The application presents significant attack surfaces that could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and potential system takeover.

2. METHODOLOGY AND GOALS
------------------------
Objectives:
- Identify critical security weaknesses
- Assess potential unauthorized access vectors
- Evaluate cryptographic and configuration vulnerabilities
- Provide actionable remediation strategies

3. RECOMMENDED ATTACK VECTORS
-----------------------------
Primary Attack Vectors:
a) Secret Key Exploitation
   - Attempt session hijacking
   - Generate forged authentication tokens
   - Exploit weak cryptographic implementations

b) Debug Information Extraction
   - Trigger verbose error responses
   - Enumerate application internals
   - Identify potential information disclosure points

c) Token Compromise
   - Exploit long-lived JWT tokens
   - Attempt token theft and impersonation
   - Test token validation weaknesses

d) CSRF Attack Scenarios
   - Craft malicious cross-site requests
   - Bypass non-existent CSRF protections
   - Execute unauthorized actions

4. ATTACK NARRATIVES
--------------------
```
ATTACK SCENARIO: TOKEN HIJACK
------------------------------
   [Attacker]  -----> [Weak Secret Key]
        |               |
        v               v
   [Generate Tokens] [Forge Credentials]
        |               |
        v               v
   [Unauthorized Access] --> [System Compromise]
```

```
ATTACK SCENARIO: DEBUG EXPLOIT
------------------------------
   [Attacker] -----> [Debug Mode = True]
        |               |
        v               v
   [Trigger Errors] [Extract System Details]
        |               |
        v               v
   [Information Gathering] --> [Targeted Exploitation]
```

5. CONCLUSION
-------------
High Priority Vulnerabilities Discovered: 6
Severity: Critical

Recommended Immediate Actions:
- Replace SECRET_KEY with a strong, randomly generated value
- Disable DEBUG mode in production
- Implement strict ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration
- Use strong password hashing (e.g., PBKDF2)
- Implement short-lived, rotatable JWT tokens
- Re-enable CSRF middleware
- Conduct comprehensive security review
